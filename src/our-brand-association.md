Use Eko’s digital and physical infrastructure to reach the 800 million cash earning Indians. Low & Middle Income (LMI) consumers are under-served on digital as well as financial products. Eko provides solutions that help you reach this base in a variety of ways. Some of the brands leveraging our infrastructure are:

AltBalaji tied up with Eko in July 2019 to help expand their penetration, especially in the LMI segment. These customers who have viewing habits in line with their digitally abled peers in tier 1 and tier 2 cities were able to leverage Eko’s 150,000 strong merchant network to be assisted with their app downloads as well as pay for their subscription in cash.

Shopclues identified Eko’s physical network as an important opportunity in the assisted commerce space. Our merchants, who tend to be digitally savvy as well as adept at using our proprietary platform ‘Connect’, help the end customer with relevant products. This mutually beneficial relationship forms an additional revenue source for our retailers as well as help Shopclues with their tier 3,4,5 expansion.

With non life insurance products having a less than 1% pan-India penetration, Edelweiss foresaw a valuable opportunity in leveraging Eko’s network to introduce sachet insurance products. Our merchants are helping Edelweiss expand their insurance base as well as helping the underinsured get more coverage.
