**Top 5 Low Budget Business Ideas For 2022**

Creating a business for your new startup can be a daunting task, as it requires money and resources to achieve your goal. That said, there are a few low cost business ideas to create an income without spending too much cash. Our article will highlight five of the best low-budget ideas for those looking to create an income or looking for great ways to earn. These businesses are relatively easy to implement, require minimal amounts of manpower, and have high-profit margins.

**1. Become an Insurance Agent:** There's nothing more lucrative than selling something that people buy with hopes of never using! Insurance agents make money off people who need insurance the most. People can sign up on [Eko Connect](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.eko.connect&hl=en_IN&gl=US) application and start to sell various insurance policies available on the platform.Â 

The platform is easy to work with and people can make upto Rs.50,000 per month by providing financial services through [Eko Connect](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.eko.connect&hl=en_IN&gl=US) application.

**2. Create digital products or courses:** This is another sure fire way to earn money online. Some of the best digital products are:

2. Tutorials on working with WordPress
3. Social Media Marketing
4. How to build a website
5. How to code HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Each product requires a certain amount of technical know-how, but they can be created easily by someone who is willing to devote at least a couple of hours per day. Once you've created your repertoire, sell them to people in your niche or other similar communities using an online store or simply promote them on social media. Once you notice some initial traction, you can start charging for your service and become an authority within your industry.

**3. Use [Eko Connect](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.eko.connect&hl=en_IN&gl=US) App to do mobile recharges and money transfer/collection:** You can download the app and start offering simple yet necessary services like money transfer, cash withdrawal and mobile recharges. The [Connect app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.eko.connect&hl=en_IN&gl=US) will let you transfer money using bank accounts and you will be paid a commission for each transaction that is performed by you making it a great way to earn. You can also use it to make recharges and collect cash easily. People will really find it helpful for all those times when they want to transfer/recharge but don't have cash. Another special feature of **[Eko Connect](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.eko.connect&hl=en_IN&gl=US)** application is that it also allows you to perform AePS transactions. Using AePS you do not need to remember the bank account details or ATM pin and only perform the transaction using the biometric verification.

**4. Sell Custom Printed Products**: If you have any sort of product that you design and can produce quickly, then consider selling it as a custom printed physical gift. This might include t-shirts, prints, and even stickers. If your product is available for direct sale then the profit margin becomes zero due to the cost of production being significantly higher than the actual cost of maintaining your company. However, one way to circumvent this issue is to use a fulfillment center that will allow you to print products on demand. You can take the advantage of e-commerce to take order online and sub contract the orders to the people who can fulfil the orders making it a more profitable business.

**5. Start Affiliate Marketing:** Getting involved in affiliate marketing can be a great way to earn money online. If you're already an expert in your niche, then it might be great for you to use your knowledge and create a blog that promote different products from different companies. Another option is to promote companies that pay you commission for each sale they make through your link.

Again, the main task here is simply creating content and providing value; the product will come later because people who are brand loyal can always seek out those products through affiliate marketing websites on their own. As with all of these programs, if you're willing to do a bit of work and put in some effort, then there's no reason why this wouldn't prove profitable for you in the future.

Final Words**

All of the ideas we've mentioned above have been proven time and time again to work. However, as with anything in life, you need to remain focused and keep a positive attitude. If you're willing to put in the work, then there's no reason why you can't succeed.
