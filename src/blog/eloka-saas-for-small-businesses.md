#### 7. Technology for the Last Mile – The Path Ahead

With our years of experience in building fintech software for the last-mile, we ensure that the app is as easy to use for first time internet users as it is capable for power users.

Not just features like localization in regional languages, we are also researching to leverage technologies from voice input to artificial intelligence and machine learning.

Generative AI can aid in automating customer service, thereby providing a tailored and efficient user experience. Meanwhile, voice input technology makes the platform accessible to those who may find traditional interfaces challenging to navigate.

By adopting these technologies, we aim to create an inclusive ecosystem that doesn't just serve but excels in meeting the unique needs of the last-mile users.
