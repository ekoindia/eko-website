Some jobs will require some experience, like data entry and transcription, while others need no prior experience at all, like selling products on eBay or Amazon. This blog post will outline five of those work-at-home opportunities for both students and housewives alike. As you can see, there is a job for everyone here!

**1. Data Entry: No prior experience required!**

As a student struggling to find work, this could be the perfect fallback if your career search has been unsuccessful so far. There are a number of companies that provide data entry services, and some of them will let you work from home.

**2. Download the Connect App : Earn by doing money transfer and mobile recharge**

The idea is simple: download the Connect App and start making money by doing money transfer and mobile recharge for anyone who needs to do it urgently. On every transaction made, you will earn a certain percentage of the transfer amount. You don't need any prior experience or expertise to earn through this, you just have to download the app and find customers around you who want to deposit money, withdraw money, transfer money or need quick mobile recharge for them. All you need to do is to learn how to use the app. 

**3. Start Reselling Products**

This is one of the already tried and tested ideas by a lot of housewives out there and it works! All you have to do is to sign up on any reselling app like meesho, create an account and share good products from there to people who might be interested in buying them. You can sell through whatsapp, facebook groups or anywhere that people would click on your link and make a purchase.

**4. Home Tutor: Needs experience and good communication skills**

If you have good knowledge in English, Mathematics, Science, History, Geography or any of the language (Hindi / Gujarati / Arabic / Telugu / Urdu etc. ) than it could be a good option for you to earn money from home by teaching these subjects to students who are in need of home tutors. To do this job, you will require work experience as a tutor. You can search for potential students on sites such as superprof or shiksha. 

**5. Become a Virtual Assistant: Great for those who want to be their own boss**

If you want to work at home, but don't want to go through all the hassle of running your own business, this could be the perfect opportunity. Virtual Assistants help people with a variety of tasks that they may not have the time or expertise to do (but you probably will). Some of these jobs include email marketing, prospecting and creating sales funnels. 

Final words

There are still many great opportunities for students to earn money from home. The key is finding a way to make it part of your daily routine, so that it becomes a habit and you can't imagine your life without earning money from home. 

The five jobs this article described are only the beginning and there are many more options like these that you can find on the internet.
