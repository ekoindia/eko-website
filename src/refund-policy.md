## Refund Types

Following are the various types of refunds that you can use to refund payments to your customers:

### 1. Normal Refund

Amount is refunded within 5 – 7 working days.

### 2. Instant Refund

Amount is refunded almost immediately.

By issuing instant refunds to your customers, you can provide a better user experience for them. This also helps in improving their reliability and trust in your business.


## Handle Refund Chargeback

For the prevention of chargebacks, **Eko** only does source refunds. It means that money is refunded to the payment method that the customer used to make the payment. For example, if a credit card was used to make the payment, the refund is pushed to the same credit card. Similarly, in the case of UPI payments, the refund is pushed to the VPA used while making the payment.

If a chargeback is received for an instantly refunded payment, the processed refund will have a UTR (Unique Transfer Reference) in the callback. The UTR serves as a proof of refund completed between you and **Eko**.
